  The Password Strength Checker is a Java program designed to help users create more secure passwords by evaluating and providing feedback on their strength. This simple yet effective tool assesses a password based on several criteria, including length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
  The program performs a series of checks to ensure the password meets essential security standards. It verifies that the password is at least 8 characters long, contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one numerical digit, and one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*). Based on the criteria met, the password is classified into one of several strength levels: Very Strong, Strong, Medium, Weak, or Very Weak.
